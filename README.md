Full Stack Dockerized Application (Node.js + Flask):

This project demonstrates a simple full-stack web application using Node.js with Express as the frontend and Flask as the backend, fully containerized using Docker.

Project Overview :

The frontend contains an HTML form built with Express and Node.js.

The form sends user data to the Flask backend using HTTP POST requests.

The Flask backend receives the data, processes it, and returns a response.

Both frontend and backend run inside Docker containers.

Docker Compose is used to connect both services in the same network.
